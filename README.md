Welcome to our DevOps journey!
This project was developed as part of our advanced academic curriculum to help us apply what weâ€™ve learned about DevOps in a real-world setting. The goal was to move beyond theory and gain hands-on experience with tools and practices used by professionals in the industry.

In this project, we focused on automating the setup and deployment of an application using popular DevOps tools. We used GitHub for version control to manage our code and track changes. With Ansible, we automated the process of setting up and configuring servers, saving time and reducing errors. Docker was used to containerize the application, making it easy to run the same way on different machines. For hosting, we used AWS EC2 to create cloud-based virtual machines where the application runs.

We also built a simple CI/CD pipeline that automatically pulls the latest code, builds the Docker container, and deploys the updated application to the server. This means that every time we make changes to the code, the system updates the live version of the app without manual steps.

This project gave us valuable experience in using DevOps tools to create a reliable and repeatable deployment process, similar to what is done in real-world tech environments.
